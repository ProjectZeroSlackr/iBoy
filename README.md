Overview:
iBoy
- iBoy is an optimized port of gnuboy, a Nintendo Gameboy Original/
  Gameboy Color emulator, to iPodLinux.
- It is extremely well optimized, very stable and one of the most
  well known and widely used emulators for iPodLinux and has a
  long history, appearing in a number of past publications
  (magazine and online) featuring iPodLinux.
For more information, see:
- http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/iBoy
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuboy
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color

Usage:
- FastLaunch through "Emulators > iBoy > FastLaunch" or
  use "Emulators > iBoy > Roms" to select a rom to play
  (after the emulator starts, choose "Return to game").
- Files with a ".gb" and ".gbc" extension have their default
  action set to iBoy.
- Rom files should be placed in the "Roms" folder.
  Public domain rom files can be optained through various
  internet websites while commercial rom files should be dumped
  from real Gameboy game cartriages (downloading commercial
  roms that you do not own is ILLEGAL). Public domain roms can
  be found here: http://www.pdroms.de/files/gameboy/
- You may want to edit the "Conf/iboy.cfg" file if you want to
  change settings, etc.
- iPod mini users should replace the "Conf/iboy.cfg" file with
  "Conf/iboy.cfg_3g_mini" for better scaling.
